			<h3> Solar Panels </h3>
			<p> Solar panels are constructed
			of a layer of silicon cells, a metal frame, a glass casing surrounded by a special
		  foil and a lot of wires. The solar-cells, which are also called photovoltaic
			cells, absorb the sunlight.  </p>
		</article>

		<article id = "article2" class="article">
			<h3> Charge Controller </h3>
			<p>The charge controller makes sure that the battries in the system do not get overcharged. It regulates the current and voltage
			coming from the solar panels going into the battries. Most 12 volt solar panels have an output of more than 16 volts. So
		  if there was nothing to control the current and voltage, the batteries would be permanently damaged.</p>
		</article>

		<article id = "article3" class="article">
			<h3> Battery System </h3>
			<p>If your solar panels produce more energy than necessary, the power is loaded into the battery system. Most battery systems have their own inverter and charge controller.
			The battery system lets you store a lot of power for later use. It makes your solar panel project efficient and sustainable!</p>
		</article>

		<article id = "article4" class="article">
			<h3> DC Power </h3>
			<p>If everything works correctly, you'll have solar panels working efficiently to transform sunlight into electricity.
				The electricity generated is called direct current, also called "DC", electricity</p>
		</article>

		<article id = "article5" class="article">
			<h3> Inverter </h3>
			<p>The inverter makes sure that the DC power generated by the solar panels is converted to AC power. This is necessary because
			all homes run on AC power. To make proper AC power, you need a switch that allows you to invert the current completely and do that
			around 50‚Äê60 times every single second.</p>
		</article>

		<article id = "article6" class="article">
			<h3> AC power </h3>
			<p>AC or "alternating current" electricity is used by most homes to power their
			devices. First you need to convert the DC electricity. That is the job of the so called "Inverter".</p>
