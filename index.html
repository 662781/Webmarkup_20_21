					This device is used to control the electricity flow of your solarpanel-system.
					It has advanced security to make sure that it will shutdown if overheated and/or over throttled.
					It also monitors the amount of wattage the device is using and wether or not that is accurate.
					If there is to much shadow on your solarpanels this device will try to use less power to minimalize power use.
					You can access this device by simply connecting to bluetooth via your preferred mobile-device.
					It comes at a very decent price and is now available at the store linked underneath the picture!
